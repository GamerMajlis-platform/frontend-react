## Marketplace / Products

- **#47 — Create Product Listing**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/products` (multipart/form-data)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `createProduct(formData: FormData)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/pages/Marketplace.tsx` — minimal `CreateProductForm` posts a `FormData` and refreshes the product list.

- **#48 — Upload Product Images**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/products/{productId}/images` (multipart/form-data)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `uploadProductImages(productId, files)`
  - UI: upload helper exists in service; multi-image UI is intentionally small/placeholder (image upload UX can be expanded).

- **#49 — Get Product Details**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/products/{productId}`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `getProduct(productId)`
  - Wired in UI: available to pages/components that need product detail (service ready).

- **#50 — Get Products List**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/products?page=...&size=...`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `listProducts(query)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/pages/Marketplace.tsx` — uses `listProducts` to display marketplace cards and seeds local wishlist flags.

- **#51 — Update Product**

  - Endpoint: `PUT /api/products/{productId}` (form-data)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `updateProduct(productId, data)`
  - UI: service available; full edit form UI is TBD.

- **#52 — Delete Product**

  - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/products/{productId}`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `deleteProduct(productId)`
  - UI: service available; delete confirmation UI is TBD.

- **#55 — Toggle Product Wishlist**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/products/{productId}/wishlist` (no body)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProductService.ts` → `toggleWishlist(productId)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` → `toggleWishlist` calls the service (updates local wishlist state and posts to backend); `src/components/shared/Card.tsx` uses `useAppContext().toggleWishlist()`.

- **#57, #58, #59, #56 (Search/Categories/Featured/View)**
  - Endpoints implemented in `src/services/ProductService.ts` as helper methods where appropriate (e.g., `searchProducts`, `getCategories`, `getFeatured`, `recordView`). These are available for wiring into UI as needed.

## Events

- **#36 — Create Event**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/events` (form-data)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `createEvent(formData)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/components/events/CreateEventForm.tsx` — comprehensive event creation form with validation, accessibility, and file upload support. Integrated into `src/pages/Events.tsx` with modal display.

- **#37 — Get Event Details**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/events/{eventId}`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `getEvent(eventId)`

- **#39 — Update Event**

  - Endpoint: `PUT /api/events/{eventId}` (form-data)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `updateEvent(eventId, formData)`
  - UI: service ready; edit functionality can be added to event forms.

- **#40 — Delete Event**

  - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/events/{eventId}`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `deleteEvent(eventId)`
  - UI: service ready; delete confirmation can be added to event management.

- **#41 — Register for Event**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/events/{eventId}/register`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `registerForEvent(eventId)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` → `registerForEvent` function calls service and updates local state. Event cards show registration status and allow registration/unregistration.

- **#42 — Unregister from Event**

  - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/events/{eventId}/register`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `unregisterFromEvent(eventId)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` → `unregisterFromEvent` function integrated with registration state management.

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/events/{eventId}/checkin`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `checkInAttendee(eventId, attendeeId)`
  - UI: service ready for event check-in functionality.

- **#45 — Search Events**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/events/search?q=...&location=...&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `searchEvents(query)`
  - Wired in UI: `src/pages/Events.tsx` — real-time search with debouncing (300ms), supports text search and advanced filtering.

- **#46 — Get Trending Events**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/events/trending?limit=...`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/EventService.ts` → `getTrendingEvents(limit)`
  - UI: service ready for trending events sections and recommendations.

## Tournaments

- **#74 — Create Tournament**

  - Endpoint: `POST /api/tournaments` (JSON body)
  - Implemented in: `src/services/TournamentService.ts` → `createTournament(payload)`
  - UI: service exists; tournament create UI is pending (suggested `src/pages/Tournaments.tsx`).

- **#75 — Get Tournament Details**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/tournaments/{id}`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/TournamentService.ts` → `getTournament(id)`

- **#76 — Update Tournament**

  - Implemented in: `src/services/TournamentService.ts` → `deleteTournament(id)`

- **#78, #79, #80, #81**
  - Additional tournament endpoints (list, by-organizer, add moderator, increment view) are available and the service provides helper methods for them.

## Profile / Auth (partial integration)

- **#8 — Get My Profile**

  - Endpoint: `GET /api/profile/me`
  - Implemented in: `src/services/ProfileService.ts` → `getMyProfile()` (existing service)
  - Wired in App: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` — session initialization calls `ProfileService.getMyProfile()` to refresh optimistic user data and merges JSON fields like `privacySettings` and `gamingPreferences` into local settings.

- **Auth endpoints (#1..#7, #88..#93)**
  - `AuthService.ts` provides login/logout/signup helpers mapped to `APIs_guide.md`. The core login flow uses `src/services/AuthService.ts` and `src/context/AppContext.tsx` for storing tokens and session initialization. Specific endpoints used by UI: `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `POST /api/auth/signup`, `GET /api/auth/me`.

## Notes & Status

- What "implemented" means here:

  - A service method exists that calls the documented backend endpoint (uses the project's `apiFetch` wrapper).
  - UI wiring indicates whether the service is already used in a page/component (e.g., `Marketplace` uses product list and create; `Events` uses the events list). If UI is not yet wired, the service is still present and ready.

- Quick status summary:
  - **Product APIs**: Core CRUD, images, wishlist toggle, search/categories implemented and wired to `Marketplace` for listing + creating products. Wishlist toggle (`#55`) is fully integrated through `AppContext` and UI components.
  - **Event APIs**: Complete implementation of all 11 event endpoints with comprehensive UI integration. Features include event creation with validation, listing with search/filtering, registration management, and trending events. Full TypeScript types and English/Arabic translations included.
  - **Tournament APIs**: Core CRUD methods implemented in services; Events list is used in `src/pages/Events.tsx`, but full create/edit UIs are pending.
  - **Profile APIs**: Profile retrieval (`#8`) integrated into `AppContext` session init, merging server JSON fields into local settings.

If you want, next I can:

1. Wire explicit create forms for Events and Tournaments into `src/pages/Events.tsx` and `src/pages/Tournaments.tsx` so you can seed those resources from the frontend (recommended).
2. Add small unit tests for `ProductService` and `EventService` methods (lightweight mocks).
3. Expand multi-image upload UI for products and attach it to `uploadProductImages`.

If any of the service file paths above look different in your local copy, tell me and I'll update this file to match exactly.
